Ameture Wordle Bot

This small wordle bot works by using a predefined guessable word list. For each turn it returns the words with the highest score - the score of each of the words is defined by a scoring function which is based on the frequency of each of the letters the word contains. To optimize the program is prohibitted to guess words with repeated letters and the result the score is based on the existing word list and hence is changed after each turn. After each turn the word list is adjusted i.e. it removes all the words that do not match the given respoonse.
